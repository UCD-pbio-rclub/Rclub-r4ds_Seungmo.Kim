### 5.6 Grouped summaries with summarise()
```{r}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
```{r grouped_summary}
by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) # get the average delay per date
```
#### 5.6.1 Combining multiple operations with the pipe
we want to explore the relationship between the distance and average delay for each location.
```{r}
by_dest <- group_by(flights, dest)
delay <- summarise(by_dest,
  count = n(),
  dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
  delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
)
delay <- filter(delay, count > 20, dest != "HNL")
```

# It looks like delays increase with distance up to ~750 miles 
# and then decrease. Maybe as flights get longer there's more 
# ability to make up delays in the air?
```{r}
ggplot(delay, aes(x = dist, y = delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
```{r}
  group_by(flights, dest) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")
```
#### 5.6.2 Missing values

Without na.rm = TRUE
The usual rule of missing values: if thereâ€™s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value.
```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay))
```
With na.rm = TRUE which removes the missing values prior to computation
```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
To save a data set of not_cancelled
```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay))

not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))
```

```{r}

```

#### 5.6.3 Counts
To look at the planes (identified by their tail number) that have the highest average delays:
```{r}
delays <- not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(
    delay = mean(arr_delay)
  )

ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = delay)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 10)
```
To draw a scatterplot of number of flights vs. average delay:
```{r}
delays <- not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )

ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = n, y = delay)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10)
```
To filter out the groups with the smallest numbers of observations, so you can see more of the pattern and less of the extreme variation in the smallest groups. 
```{r}
delays %>% 
  filter(n > 25) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = n, y = delay)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 1/10)
```
